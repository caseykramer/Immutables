Immutables
----------

A small collection of immutable collections, and other objects which I've grown rather fond of working with Scala.  This is really a playground more than anything else, I'm curious about whether or not they could be useful in some contexts.  Lets face it, one thing .Net is lacking is good immutable collection support.
